            Immerse yourself in the heart of our marina community by leasing one of our private slips. As true boat aficionados know, there’s no better way to relax and enjoy your leisure. Designed to handle even the largest craft, our houseboat slips provide power hook-ups for easy recharging and in-dock servicing and are the ideal place to start and end your New Melones Lake experience.

            Our slips are just a short stroll from the marina. Here you can mingle with your fellow owners, enthusiasts, and travelers. Trade your favorite New Melones Lake stories over a drink. Or simply relax on your own fore-deck to the gentle lapping of the water and take in the striking views. All the pleasure of New Melones Lake is right within reach when you lease at New Melones Lake Marina.
